Version 0.2: 
   Line 103, fixed the missing "-n" option (Thanks to Chad who pointed this out
   this out for me). Also added a "shopt -s extglob". (Thx to Chad)

Version 0.5: 
   Line 168, fixed a typo (EXIT_UNKNOWN to STATE_UNKNOWN)

Version 0.7:
   Line 193, modified sensor parsing to cut after the first '+' since all
     positive temperatures are preceded by a '+'
   Line 211, reduced "verbosity" needed to see verbose info (was 2: -v -v)
   Line 229-232, now checks to see if no sensor data was found and
     exits with STATE_UNKNOWN

Version 0.8:
   Line 196 and 230, added 'head -n1' to only fetch the first result from
     sensors output. On some machine you get two Core0 and two Core1 temps.
   Moved version history to it's own file, HISTORY

Version 0.94:
    Lots of changes and bugfixes. A huge thank you to Ryan Loudfoot who
    has fixed bugs and worked out a new way to detect the sensors-program.
    In 0.94 I removed /etc from the whereis path as it didn't work for me
    on my setup. It found the config-file for lm-sensors and tried to run
    it.

Version 0.95:
    Changed the Performance Data Field to only contain a label and the
    actual value in celsius. For example, "temperature=39".

Version 1.0:
    Several improvements made by Nikodimos, including:
     - Added support for multiple sensors
     - Enriched performance data output. For example, "CPU=34;40;55 MB=32;40;55"
     - Changed (and improved) the way temperatures are retrieved
     - Other fixes and touch-ups, such as the help text now shows long options

Version 1.1:
	Improvements for Icinga 2, made by Onkobu
	 - order of arguments is irrelevant now, --sensor first ignored following -c & -w
	 - current sensors' multiline output needs sophisticated treatment

Version 1.2:
	Fixes for multi sensor, made by Onkobu
	 - each sensor appears exactly once in message and in performance metrics
	Test infrastructure
	 - some Bash scripts and sample output mocking sensors' output
	 - outlined some terms (device, adapter, sensor) in README
	 - short explanation how to add tests in README
